# UECFI website and CMS

## Local website
Project: C:/Users/User/Documents/ChatGPT/fys d23
Website: http://127.0.0.1:8005
Administrator: http://127.0.0.1:8005/admin/login

The local installation uses SQLite so it works without a separate database server.
The migrations support MySQL/MariaDB. The example environment retains MySQL placeholders.
The original /generate POST endpoint remains available.

Start from PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\User\Documents\ChatGPT\fys d23"
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8005
```

## Fresh installation
Use PHP 8.5 for the supplied dependency lock file, Composer 2, PDO, PDO SQLite (local), or PDO MySQL (hosting), fileinfo, mbstring, openssl, DOM and XML.
```
composer install
```
Copy .env.example to .env. Configure the database, then:
```
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class=CmsSeeder
php artisan cms:admin your-email@example.com
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8005
```
The administrator command securely prompts for a password (12+ characters).
There is no public registration, default production password or pretend password-reset endpoint.

## Content studio
- Dashboard reports published content counts and recent edits.
- News, Achievements and Activities support create/edit/delete, draft/publish, scheduled publication, featured flag, unique slugs and numeric ordering.
- A published item needs a publication time at or before now to appear publicly.
- Preview saved drafts using the private Preview link.
- Upload cover images directly from each news, achievement, and activity editor.
- Upload activity gallery images directly inside the activity editor; new uploads replace the current gallery.
- Upload officer portraits directly inside each officer editor.
- Homepage cover images are selected or uploaded directly from Home settings.
- The admin Media Library screen has been removed. Uploaded files are still stored safely and served through their content references.
- Officers are grouped by hierarchy level and ordered within each level using Sort order. Profiles open in accessible dialogs.
- Upload JPG, PNG, WebP or GIF images up to 5 MB each (maximum 12 in one request).
- Media in use cannot be deleted until its references are removed.
- Edit Website provides homepage text, statistics, buttons, imagery, section headings, order and visibility.
- Brand Settings controls logo, favicon and colors. The original supplied logo is installed unchanged.
- Navigation changes the six public navigation labels.
- Website Settings controls the organization, contact details and social links.
- Footer controls its heading, supporting text and copyright.
- Hero text and colors update in the editor preview as you type. Other changes appear after saving and refreshing the preview.
- Settings save directly to the public website. Article drafts are separate.
- Account page allows password changes.
- Text content is escaped; arbitrary HTML/JavaScript is never executed.

## Shared hosting
1. Select PHP 8.5 and verify requirements with composer check-platform-reqs.
2. Create a MySQL database and database user in the hosting dashboard.
3. Upload the application OUTSIDE the public document root. Configure the domain document root to the application's public directory.
4. Configure .env with APP_ENV=production, APP_DEBUG=false, your HTTPS APP_URL, SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true, and real DB_CONNECTION=mysql, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD.
5. Preserve APP_KEY across deployments. Generate it only for a new installation.
6. Install locked dependencies: composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader.
7. Run php artisan migrate --force. Run CmsSeeder once if initial sample content/settings are desired; it does not overwrite existing records.
8. Create a real admin using php artisan cms:admin.
9. Ensure storage and bootstrap/cache are writable by the PHP process; never use world-writable permissions.
10. Run php artisan config:cache, php artisan route:cache and php artisan view:cache.
11. Back up the database and storage/app/public before upgrades.

Uploaded images are served through the /media/{id} route; symlinks are not required.
No Node.js process, queue worker or build server is required on hosting.
The implementation uses Blade, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and local GSAP / ScrollTrigger 3.13.0.
The starter Tailwind CDN form is retained but the CMS design uses its own stylesheet, avoiding a browser-side CSS compiler.
Google Fonts are optional external resources with system-font fallbacks.
The mountain hero image is decorative stock imagery from Unsplash (photo-1464822759023-fed622ff2c3b), not an image of a UECFI activity.
All seeded stories and officer profiles are explicitly sample content; statistics are labeled illustrative. Replace them with approved information before launch.

## Verification
```
php artisan test
php artisan view:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan route:clear
```
Feature tests exercise public routes, private drafts, login/logout, authorization, CRUD, uploads, gallery references, safe settings and output escaping.
The browser smoke script at scripts/browser-check.cjs uses the local bundled Playwright runtime for this workstation. It is a development tool, not a deployment dependency. Set CMS_TEST_PASSWORD in the process environment before running it.
Screenshots are stored privately under storage/app/private.

## Architecture
- contents: common news/achievement/activity fields, indexed type/status/date, creator and cover references.
- activity_images: ordered many-to-many gallery.
- officers: hierarchy, term, biography and portrait.
- media: stored image path, original display name and alt text.
- site_settings: validated content and branding fields.
- page_sections: editable headings, description, order and visibility.
- users: standard hashed passwords with explicit is_admin flag.
- app/Http/Controllers: separate public, authentication, content, media, officer, settings and account controllers.
- resources/views/layouts, public, admin, partials: reusable Blade templates.
- public/css/site.css and admin.css: responsive interfaces.
- public/js/site.js: splash, motion, navigation, dialogs, counters and gallery.
- public/js/admin.js: form feedback, delete confirmation and live preview.
